## About Me

I am a Brazilian researcher in the field of Applied Mathematics. I currently work at the EMC/UFG Telecommunications Laboratory and participate in a research group focused on 6th Generation Mobile Communications Technology. Our main topics of research are Signal Processing and Machine Learning.

I am also a professor at the Faculdade da Polícia Militar, where I lecture in Mathematics, Computer Science, and related disciplines. I am passionate about technology and constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Web development is one of my hobbies, and I am always looking for new projects to work on. The DIY philosophy is my motto; I continually improve my skills and knowledge in software and hardware through projects using Arduino, ESP-32, and Raspberry Pi.
